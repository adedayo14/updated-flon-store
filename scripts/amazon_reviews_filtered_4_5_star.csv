Without doubt the best dental floss I‚Äôve ever used I never thought about it previously when using plastic based floss - but such plastics are obviously bad for the body and the environment.","Without doubt the best dental floss I‚Äôve ever used I never thought about it previously when using plastic based floss - but such plastics are obviously bad for the body and the environment. This silk floss however is PLASTIC FREE - and produced ethically without harming the silkworms. Made of Organic Ahimsa (Peace) Silk - a totally Natural Dental Silk thread Eco friendly,Biodegradable and Compostable. This is a sustainable Zero Waste, Natural Way to Clean your teeth. I‚Äôm delighted with it, it‚Äôs far stronger than I was led to believe from other reviews and quite honestly the slight roughness to the thread means it‚Äôs far more effective at removing plaque etc. my teeth feel amazing! I will never go back to plastic floss or buy silk that is not Ahimsa (a method that is friendly to the silk worms ‚Ä¶.. you need to know this as silk products that are not Ahimsa are not friendly toward silk worms (non-ahimsa methods involve boiling the silk worms which is of course disgusting‚Ä¶. Whereas this ahimsa silk allows the silk worms to flourish and live a happy life).",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132
D. Gilbert,2 December 2022,5.0,Does better job than plastic floss I have used this for a couple of years and my gums hate it when I run out - this floss is far superior at removing caught up bits of food than the traditional plastic floss.,"I have used this for a couple of years and my gums hate it when I run out - this floss is far superior at removing caught up bits of food than the traditional plastic floss. It is less smooth so it catches more. It will sometimes break when flossing, being a natural material, but it's well worth it. My gums love it and even my dentist wanted to know what I am using to get such good results.",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132
Amazon Customer,10 December 2020,4.0,"it takes time to change habits If you are expecting the same experience as with your standard dental floss, you might be disappointed.","If you are expecting the same experience as with your standard dental floss, you might be disappointed. This is not to say that it is way worse, but it is just different. The floss doesn't have the same texture - at times it feels like flossing your teeth with slightly thicker thread. The good thing about it is that it doesn't snap so easily, but I couldn't feel any peppermint. Oh, and don't be mislead by the picture - the packaging is tiny. On the good note is that it comes in a glass jar and is more environmentally friendly",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132

pc,5 December 2022,5.0,"works for me For me, this floss is the perfect thickness.","For me, this floss is the perfect thickness. It is strong and does not fray. There is no flavour, which is no bad thing. Happy that it is relatively more environmentally friendly than most other flosses. Could be improved by providing an option for a glass dispenser, but I am just as happy to do without one. Less is more. I would buy it again.",Silk Dental Floss Refill,6691a9fd1034680012078368
Melodie Hyams,29 August 2023,4.0,Almost perfect eco floss I decided to try eco floss to reduce my personal plastic 'footprint'.,"I decided to try eco floss to reduce my personal plastic 'footprint'. I've been using FLON for over a year now. It's good but just a little more breakable than standard (non-eco) floss and not as 'silky' as I would like. Having said that, there is always one area of my mouth where it breaks, due to a tight squeeze and a sharpish tooth, so that may not be an issue for others. I'd prefer a little more pepermint taste, there's very little, if any. For perfection, an indication of where to cut it for the ideal length would be useful. I often feel I've been excessive but it's quite difficult to judge, so I err on too much which is not ideal for my waste reduction aspirations! I've decided to have a whirl with the EcoYou Bamboo Charcoal Dental Floss. I don't really like the idea of black floss but if it's less breakable that would be preferable. So those are the pros and cons from my perspective. In spite of the quibbles, I would still recommend it. You really just need to try it for yourself...",Silk Dental Floss Refill,6691a9fd1034680012078368

Crowolf,2 December 2022,5.0,This doesn't break between your teeth. Unlike other well-known and more expensive makes of fluoride free dental floss this does not snap off between your teeth and if like me you have teeth that are close together finding a floss that doesn't break can turn into an online quest.,Unlike other well-known and more expensive makes of fluoride free dental floss this does not snap off between your teeth and if like me you have teeth that are close together finding a floss that doesn't break can turn into an online quest. As this dental floss is made out of silk it slides between the teeth with comfort and has a nice taste to it too. The silk is harvested humanely and to me seems the best medium for the job.,Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132
Andrew and Andrew's Wife,13 July 2023,5.0,Does the job it is designed for. I have teeth that are very close together but this gets between them and flosses well.,"I have teeth that are very close together but this gets between them and flosses well. You need to pull a fair amount off and warp around your fingers and be gentle as you floss but if you get the knack of it, one strand will work for the whole mouth. I will be buying this product regularly from now on.",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132

KittyCat,25 December 2020,5.0,Excellent eco floss! I never thought about an ‚Äòeco‚Äô dental floss until I saw them on here - I‚Äôm so glad I bought it!,"I never thought about an ‚Äòeco‚Äô dental floss until I saw them on here - I‚Äôm so glad I bought it! After looking at other brands which weren‚Äôt 100% biodegradable, this brand seemed to be a lot better and honest (from what I‚Äôve read...). The floss worked a lot better than I thought and didn‚Äôt break off while flossing. Didn‚Äôt even break when flossing awkward back teeth. Definitely recommend and I love that there are refills. So much better for the ocean and planet! The glass jar is small, so easy to store too.",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132
Steph L,11 May 2020,5.0,Great quality floss I recently ordered this product to see what it was like as I am trying to limit the amount of single use plastic I use.,"I recently ordered this product to see what it was like as I am trying to limit the amount of single use plastic I use. The mint flavour is quite subtle, which I like, and it the floss itself is much stronger than the previous eco-friendly flosses I have used with no breakage when getting those back teeth! Delivery was pretty quick given the current Covid delays and the packaging is really cute. I will definitely order again.",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132

Lena Lo,16 November 2020,5.0,Plastic free floss that doesn't break - and doesn't break the bank! I am trying to reduce my plastic waste and came across this brilliant little product: floss made out of (ethically sourced) silk in a cute glass container.,"I am trying to reduce my plastic waste and came across this brilliant little product: floss made out of (ethically sourced) silk in a cute glass container. I was a bit worried at first whether it would have the same strength as standard plastic floss, but am glad to say that it's standing up very well to my rigorous flossing. The texture of the floss is a bit uneven but I think this actually helps its purpose. I found getting the first bit of floss through the cutting mechanism a bit fiddly but haven't had any issues since then. It's cute, it's functional, it's ethical and it's well-priced.",Silk Dental Floss,61b4115d1078bd01333c3132
